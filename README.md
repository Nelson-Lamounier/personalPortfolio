## üõ†Ô∏è Architecture & Deployment

The full application is hosted on **AWS** and structured for scalability and modularity:

- **Frontend** is containerised and deployed using **Docker + ECS**.
- **Infrastructure as Code** defined using **CloudFormation nested stacks**, managing services like ECS, ECR, IAM, VPC, and ALB.
- **Contact Form** is handled via **serverless Lambda functions**, triggered by **API Gateway** and integrated with **SES**.
- **Domain routing and SSL** managed via **Amazon Route 53 + ACM**.
- Additional demo apps (also containerised) are deployed as **separate ECS services** behind the same ALB.

## üß™ Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates:

- Full lifecycle software development: from frontend to backend to infrastructure.
- Real-world DevOps practices including Dockerisation, CI/CD pipelines, and secure IAM configuration.
- Scalable, cloud-native application hosting on **AWS using production-ready patterns**.
